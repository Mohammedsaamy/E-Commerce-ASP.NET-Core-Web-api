About Simple E-Commerce Back-End ASP .NET Core Web API Project with SQL DB

## I've developed an ASP.NET Core Web API project using a code-first approach, integrating modern tools and techniques to build a scalable and secure backend system.
## 1- Identity Framework for Authentication:
Integrated the Identity Framework for user authentication and authorization, providing role-based access control. Admin-exclusive actions are restricted to authorized users only.
## 2- Authentication with JWT Tokens:
Implemented JWT token authentication for secure user authentication, ensuring data privacy and integrity. Users can securely log in and register with encrypted passwords.
## 3- Database Integration with Microsoft SQL Server and Entity Framework Core:
Utilized Microsoft SQL Server database and Entity Framework Core for seamless data storage and retrieval. Employed LINQ queries for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
## 4- Layered Structure and Repository Pattern:
Organized the project into a layered structure, separating concerns for better maintainability and scalability. Employed the repository pattern to abstract data access logic, promoting code reusability and testability.
## 5- DTOs for Data Transfer:
Used Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to transfer data between layers, ensuring clean and structured communication. DTOs help maintain a clear separation of concerns and prevent over-fetching of data.
## 6- Dependency Injection for Loose Coupling:
Leveraged ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection to achieve loose coupling and improve the testability and flexibility of the codebase.
